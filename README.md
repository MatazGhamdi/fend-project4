# Project Overview

This project is to get to know how to use Jasmine for testing. This is a udicty front-end nano degree proejct.  
I used test suits to test multiple functions on the webpage. A test suite just contains a related set of tests.


## Why this Project?  

** app.js ** - Is where the feeds load  

** jasmine/spec/feedreader.js ** - Is where the testing suits are.
